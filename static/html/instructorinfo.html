    <h1>Personalized Instructor Sites</h1>

    <p>Instructors can also obtain their own tailored course sites.  Course sites allow posting and changing equizzes, seeing student answers, distributing homeworks, collecting student answers, and posting grades.  The web interface is <em>far</em> simpler (no learning curve!) and more pleasing than anything else out there.  Click <a href='/instructor/faq'>here</a> for more information.</p>

    <p> If you want to obtain a personalized instructor site, please email <a href="mailto:ivo.welch@gmail.com">ivo.welch@gmail.com</a>.  You must include the following information:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>A gmail address (to authenticate into your site);</li>

	<li>a link to a university site so that I can confirm your identity (the site gives access to quizzes which includes answers); and</li>

	<li>A desired course name.  Your private website should be named something like <tt>http://<span style="color:blue">welch-mfe404s1-2018.ucla</span>.syllabus.space</tt>.</li>
      </ol>
