:N: Accounting Equation - Find Equity
:I: $assets=rseq(500,900)*1000; $liabilities=rseq(200,400)*1000; $ANS=$assets-$liabilities
:Q: Total assets = $$assets, total liabilities = $$liabilities. What is shareholders' equity?
:A: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Equity = Assets - Liabilities = $assets - $liabilities = $$ANS.

:N: Accounting Equation - Find Assets
:I: $liabilities=rseq(200,400)*1000; $equity=rseq(300,500)*1000; $ANS=$liabilities+$equity
:Q: Total liabilities = $$liabilities, shareholders' equity = $$equity. What are total assets?
:A: Assets = Liabilities + Equity = $liabilities + $equity = $$ANS.

:N: Accounting Equation - Find Liabilities
:I: $assets=rseq(600,1000)*1000; $equity=rseq(300,500)*1000; $ANS=$assets-$equity
:Q: Total assets = $$assets, shareholders' equity = $$equity. What are total liabilities?
:A: Liabilities = Assets - Equity = $assets - $equity = $$ANS.

:N: Current Assets

:Q: Cash $$cash, A/R $$ar, Inventory $$inventory, Prepaid expenses $$prepaid. Total current assets?
:A: Current assets = $cash + $ar + $inventory + $prepaid = $$ANS.
:T: 10
:E:

:N: Current Liabilities
:I: $ap=rseq(60,150)*1000; $accrued=rseq(30,80)*1000; $short_debt=rseq(50,150)*1000; $ANS=$ap+$accrued+$short_debt
:Q: A/P $$ap, Accrued expenses $$accrued, Short-term debt $$short_debt. Total current liabilities?
:A: Current liabilities = $ap + $accrued + $short_debt = $$ANS.

:N: Working Capital
:I: $current_assets=rseq(400,700)*1000; $current_liab=rseq(200,400)*1000; $ANS=$current_assets-$current_liab
:Q: Current assets $$current_assets, current liabilities $$current_liab. Working capital?
:A: Working capital = Current assets - Current liabilities = $current_assets - $current_liab = $$ANS.

:Q: Common stock $$common, APIC $$apic, Retained earnings $$retained, Treasury stock $$treasury. Total equity?
:A: Equity = Common + APIC + Retained - Treasury = $common + $apic + $retained - $treasury = $$ANS.
:T: 10
:E:

:N: Book Value Per Share
:I: $equity=rseq(400,800)*1000; $shares=rseq(50,150)*1000; $ANS=$equity/$shares
:Q: Total equity $$equity, shares outstanding $shares thousand. Book value per share?
:A: BVPS = Equity / Shares = $equity / ($shares × 1000) = $$ANS.
:T: 10
:E:

:N: Net Fixed Assets
:I: $gross_ppe=rseq(500,1000)*1000; $accum_depr=rseq(150,400)*1000; $ANS=$gross_ppe-$accum_depr
:Q: Gross PP&E $$gross_ppe, accumulated depreciation $$accum_depr. Net fixed assets?
:A: Net PP&E = Gross - Accumulated depreciation = $gross_ppe - $accum_depr = $$ANS.

:Q: Assets: Cash $$cash, A/R $$ar, Inventory $$inventory, PP&E $$ppe. Liabilities: A/P $$ap, Debt $$debt. What equity balances the balance sheet?
